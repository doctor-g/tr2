\section*{Subject 1}

\begin{lstlisting}
What is your favorite subject in school?
Um..probably language arts
What's your favorite app?
Like, an app that you get or just one that's on your phone?
Any
Um, well, messaging, and then, that's about it
Who do you usually talk to when messaging---school friends?
Yeah
Remind me how old you are
Fourteen
[offtopic]
Tell me about how you imagine the people who make the messaging app that you like. Where do you think those come from?
Um [looks perplexed]
Let me start with a different question: when you think about the people who make those apps, what do they look like?
Um, kind of, anything, I guess
Do you ever think about what they might have studied in school or in college?
Technology things
What do you think their favorite subject in school would be?
Maybe like, I don't know, some kind of ... math, or language arts too
You started by saying math, and you added language arts, and to a lot of people those things are very different.
Yeah
Can you tell me why you think both of those?
Well, with like, the way it's designed, and the way you can communicate with other people
OK.
[Introduce the game]
Do you have any questions ..?
At the beginning it's a little hard to tell what to do.

Did anythign surprise you?
Um, not really
What kinds of decisions did you have to make?
Whether to kind of notify people about what happened or keep it secret.
And how did you make those decisions?
Um, I guess I just kind of went with what I thought would be a good idea to do if i was in that position.
How do you know if it's a good idea or not?
Hm [shrug] cuz I don't have that kind of experience.
So what do you think about where apps come from?
I know that it usually takes a lot of people just to design little things, cuz in school in BIT last year we worked with a program called Scratch, and it was a lot harder than we thought to do stuff, to make like a bigger app or even like a little game
Can you tell me what BIT stands for?
Yeah I think it's Business In Technology but I'm not sure
Do you think you could get a job making apps?
[inaudible, but affirmative]
Lately that's what the world has been focusing on like social media, and apps and devices, and I guess there's just a lot of job opportunities for people to do that. 
So how do you think somebody who makes apps gets that job?
Um, not sure, maybe would have some kind of like start-up program where you can show what you want to make to a company or what you want to do.

[Show her how to change tasks to employees]

Can you tell me about how you're making those decisions, about who's doing what?
Um, trying to make them equal for both sides [development & maintenance skill]

Can you tell me about why everyone is on maintenance now?
Um, cuz there's more of the, I'm not sure what that one is (dev't or maintenance skill)

[game ends]
Was anything different that time?
It was a little different because I didn't know I could switch between the maintenance and development
Did that affect how you made decisions at all?
Not really.
\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage\section*{Subject 2}
\begin{lstlisting}
You're homeschooled, right?
Yeah.
Good, my kids are home schooled too. I don't know what kind of curriculum you follow, but can you tell me what your favorite kind of work is or what your favorite subject is...?
Science mostly
Science? What kinds of stuff do you do in science?
Experiments, learn about ... science, pretty much. Um... [asks mother] What science do we do Mom?
You answer!
I forget!
That's OK, tell me, how old are you?
I'm ten
Ten great. 
[off topic]
So do you use any apps?
I use... for school? or just...
At all. anything, and do you have any favorites?
I like to make pretend videos, like when I'm playing games on my mom's iPad, so yeah.
How does that work?
I just act like I'm talking to the people, and I just say what I'm doing and how I'm doing it and what I'm going to be doing and how I'm going to do it.
And you record it on the iPad then?
Yeah.
Neat. So do you ever think about the people who make those apps? They had to come from somewhere, right?
Sometimes
What do you think they look like?
I don't know, really
Try to imagine, someone who makes those apps, can you picture what they might look like or where they might be?
Not really.
OK, can you think maybe what their favorite subjects in school were?
Huh. Maybe like Math, because you kind of have to know math to kind of develop the games and do all the coding and stuff.
OK, anything else?
Not really.
Do you know any coding?
A little bit. 
What have you done?
Not really much. I've just like typed into my computer and like sometimes--most of the time nothing happened.
That's what happens to me too, and that's my job. It's hard!
[introduce game]
[Intro Ends]
So ...
[unintelligible] I just kind of...
[Shows how to click on the Alerts button]
[Demonstrate how to change task]

I can change all these guys too?
You bet

Can you tell me about what you're thinking while you're reading?
[reading screen] One of your engineers is 'connected' about, what does that say?
Injection
Injection attacks. If it's not han...dled handled correctly hackers may be able to run their programs on your machine. Who will you ... assign... to ... intestigate.

What is our goal? [Points to status screen] "Progress towards goal"?
Um, I don't remember what the number was that Frieda said. I think it's 20,000 users. Or, it was the CEO at the beginning. I think it was 20,000 users. Progress tells you what percent you are. Have you done percents in math?
Mmm mmm, not yet.
 Oh, so that might be a little confusing

Do you know what a press release is?
No.
That's when you make a public statement about what happened, you tell everybody, "Here's what happened."
[Selects it]

So the goal is so many users?
Yes, you can see your percent is over 100 now, so you've met your goal, and you have a couple hours left before the end of the game---in-game hours

[end game]
Did anything in the game surprsie you?
Like how there was _hackers_, how there was so many of them, and they were so big of a... so big of a problem to the game and stuff
And that was surprising to you?
A little bit
What do you think about the hackers?
...I don't really know.
Do you have any idea why they were attacking?
Maybe they wanted to call the game their own or something?
What kinds of decisions did you have to make in the game?
Like to see if we should tell the public or just keep it quiet about the hackers and... stuff.
I noticed when you had the option to send someone to the security conference, you sent Esteban.
Mmm hmm
Was there a reason you sent Esetban?
He's the guy [a bit cheekily stated]
When you had to investigate... I forget which attack it was, script kiddie attack maybe ... that time though you chose Janine to investigate the problems. Do you know why you chose Janine for that one?
No.
So, after playing the game do you have any thoughts about where apps come from?
Little bit.
Can you tell me about what you think that might be like?
Um,... it's like the people have to make them .. and then they have to... I'm confused. So, the apps, where they come from?
mmm hmm!
I don't really know, actually.
Do you think you could get a job making an app?
Probably not
Why is that?
I'm not that smart at making stuff when it comes to like games and stuff.
OK. [offtopic] Do you have any thoughts about how somebody  would get a job making apps?
If they're like really smart and they know like how computers work and how devices work so they know what's the best idea and stuff.
Do you have any questions for me, about the game or the study?
Not really.
\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage\section*{Subject 3}
\begin{lstlisting}
How old are you?
Twelve.
[offtopic]
What is your favorite subject when you're doing schoolwork?
probably reading
Why is that?
Just because I like the books that have a lot of, like, problems, but then they find out what the problem is and fix the problem.
Great. What is your favorite app?
I don't really have a favorite app but I do like Minecraft a lot.
What do you like about Minecraft?
I can build houses and like other buildings and stuff
Have you ever seen any pictures of notch, the guy who made minecraft.
If you imagine... Minecraft was created by a guy named notch, that's his nickname, what's his real name? Marcus Persson I think is his real name. but, now it's worked on by many many people. Can you imagine the people who make minecraft, what they might look like?
Mmm no not really
Can you imagine what kinds of things they would have liked in school?
Science, math [inaudible]
Why do you think science and math
Math because you need to know math to do like, stuff, for the game, and science because it will help you put stuff together [raises hands like slotting pieces together] to control the game, I guess
That's a good answer, that's fine. The people who made minecraft, do you think they went to college and can you imagine what they might have studied in college?
No, I don't think so.
It's a long ways away when you're twelve.
Yes
So, do you want to try our game?
Sure
[introduce the game]

OK, so, how do I figure out what to do?
Start by clicking on the blinking alerts button

do I press this? (employee area)
Sure.

[Explain the task assignment]
So I can like, press on there? (task assignment)
Mmm Hmm

[Brief talking over each other, confirming that she can use the task assignment buttons on other characters too]

What is 'maintenance'?
THat's a good question. Maintenance is keeping the current systems up and running, making sure everything is working OK, and then development is making new features.

OK, now, do I press this again?
MmmHmm

OK, so, ...
What were you going to say?
I was just going to ask you what I should do next, but ... should I change their jobs again?
You're welcome to do that, mm hmm

What does 'press release' mean? [Reads it emphasizing verb meaning of 'press']
A press release is when the company goes to the public and says, here's what's currently happening, they would tell everybody that there's a problem.

Ummm

Can you tell me about why you're making those changes?
Just to see how they work better on the... [inaudible, probably implying 'other tasks']

What does 'development' mean again?
Development is working on new features for the program

What does 'train staff' mean? [in the password event]
So you could teach your staff to use better passwords.
[selects it]

[ game ends]

Did anything surprise you in the game?
"Mm, probably how like the hackers and like the passwords and stuff. How there are hackers trying to get people's information, and how we lost people just because of [them?]
[Note that 'hackers' was a similar answer to 368.2, whose interview she was in the room for]"
Can you say anything more about why that surprised you?
mmmm I don't really know like...
It's OK. What kinds of decisions did you have to make in the game?
Figure out which people would be the best people to fix the problem and like doing something about it, not just ignoring it.
And how did you make those decisions? How did you decide who to send?
Just by what their jobs were, like 
What do you mean, when you opened them up and looked at their backgrounds?
Yeah
I noticed that when you had an option to send someone to the security confernece, you sent Nancy. Do you remember why you chose Nancy?
No, not really
And when you were looking at the injection attacks, you looked over the people and you sent Vani, the one on top
just because like she was a computer person and she liked to that kind of stuff.
At one point, one of the characters brought their daughter to work if she wants to make apps, and you chose Computer Science. You looked over the list for a while [which was not exactly true], do you remember why you chose computer science?
Just because you can make like apps on the computer and figure out how the stuff works
Can you tell me where you think apps in general come from?
mmmm
We talked about Minecraft earlier, if you think about in general, where do apps come from?
Probably from the people who make them, there's a whole bunch, people who made them, so, yeah
What kind of people do you imagine--can you tell me about these people?
Really smart and like really good at doing their job and working on computer stuff
Do you think that you could get a job making apps?
Ummmm. .... no. Probably not.
Why's that?
Just because I don't really like, think, about it a lot, and ... yeah.
OK. How do you think somebody would get that job?
Studying really hard probably
Do you have any questions about anything you saw, or any questions about the project or the study?
No.
\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage\section*{Subject 4}
\begin{lstlisting}
What is your favorite subject in school?
Um, English, like, writing. 
What do you like about it?
I like creative writing and being, like, imaginative
[offtopic]
What is your favorite computer app?
Probably like planner and calendar apps, like, organizing, so I know what's coming
Have you ever thought about the people who make those apps--the calendar and planning apps--have you thought about where they come from?
Kind of, because actually my teacher had us testing, she made an app which was a planner app such that she tested us with it. So after that I kind of did, but that was this year, but before that, not really.
[offtopic]
If you imagine the people that make apps, can you tell me what you think they look like?
Well, I'm pretty sure like people, they're like artists and stuff, like ... looks, I never really thought about that. [long pause] I picture like the people who _design_ it would be kind of like artists, kind of, messy kind of regular people, and the people who publish it would be kind of like, official, ... I don't know, yeah.
So these people who work on the apps, what do you think that they studied in college?
um...
You already mentioned there's kind of an art and design side, and a business side.
Yeah, yeah, um, art and design, and then, like, technology, if there's, like, a video game
And if you think about those same people, who make these apps, what subject do you think they liked in school?
Art... or technology
[introduce game]

"[on first page of intro]
OK, what do I, .. do I click?"
[affirm]

"[on second page of intro]
[chuckle]"

"[on third page of intro, gesturing to word ""system""]
What's this, like, your computer system?"
Yeah, the Social Jam product that they're making
[affirm]

[game start]

So do I, I'm not really sure what to do
[explain to click on alerts]

[explain task changing and clicking on faces]
Ok

Should I click on one of these here?
Sure, just before you do this event, keep in mind that you can click on these to change their tasks, too.
OK

So, are these other ones you can...
You can click on any of them
Oh

I'm not quite sure what [inaudible]
The indicator here tells you what their main job is
right
Vani is maintaining the system, keeping it secure, and Nancy is developing new features
Yeah... oh, OK, I got it

Can you tell me about how you're trying to make this decision?
I'm looking at what she studied, .. [inaudible], so what she wants to get um a job in and then like what the choices are.
[inaudible muttering to self about the options]

So how do we fix these [the exploits], is that what the alerts are?
By having people on the maintenance skill, they will be working on this.
OK
The maintenance task, I mean
Yeah

Do you want me to explain my reasoning?
Yeah yeah
OK, so, since the attack wasn't successful, and we need our people, [trails off]
Ok

[points out grammatic error in message]

[pointing to option to training employees in good passwords] Since we want to get better, so if the problem comes up again

[Indicating skill levels] So is this like how much they've done of these? Like, the numbers?
That's actually their skill at that, so how good they are at the task
Oh OK
[inaudible]

Do you know what a press release is?
No
[explains it]

Whats the line?
That's your goal.
Oh!

[clicks through the end screen]
That was the end of the game.
Oh!
It was the success screen, since you were able to  meet your goals.

[mute music]

Did anything in the game surprise you?
Um, it surprised me that I was able to get to the goal. 
Can you tell me why that surprised you?
I was expecting it to be um ... more ... i don't know [inaudible] I expected I'd have to teach more, the other people on there, um, more about [inaudible] because there's only like two or three, so that surprised me
Anything else surprise you?
[negative]
Can you tell me about what kinds of decisions you made during the game, the kinds of decisions you made and you how made them?
um, I... had to... decide whether to just let it go because it wasn't like a big deal or smaller than other problems or to um... ah ... there was some where you had to pick which of the workers would fit best with each thing, and ... 
I noticed when you had those kind of choices, you went in and looked at their bios. Do you remember what you were looking for, or how that helped you make a decision---or maybe didn't help you make a decision?
It helped me make a decision by telling me what they majored in, uh, what they were specialized in, and then just like how their personality is, like, the first one, I don't remember
Janine
Yeah, she how she was more at communicating [inaudible] other people, making them feel good, then other ones like the second one would more good at like designing and creative kind of things, and the last one was better at like fixing [inaudible] technology problems
mm hmm
So that just let me know, like if um they needed somebody to, like one of them with the hacker, they needed somebody to fix it, so I sent the last one because she was good at fixing that kind of thing. So, it just let me know which one would be best for each job.
Do you think you could get a job making apps?
Um, depending on what kind of app, if it was like a game, I probably wouldn't be very good at that, but if it was um..
Why do you say that?
I'm not usually on technology, um, usually like that, but like if there was like a coloring app or an artistic one or like a planner like I said at the beginning, I would probably be able to do that more designing. I would be better at that than [trails off]
OK, so when we imagine people who make apps, how do you imagine those people got their jobs?
Um, probably their teachers saw their ability to do something like that in an earlier stage, so then they were able to get the classes in like high school and through college to be able to get better at that
So, if a teacher saw that somebody had potential and guided them toward a path that ended up with them getting a job in a company like Social Jam, here in the game, what can you imagine that they would study in college or high school, what kinds of courses would they take? What kinds of work would they do?
I think I did, yeah, the art, and technology
Do you have any questions about anything that you saw, or about the study?
The music, it was good to have a background thing, but like it was a little bit distracting because I was trying to, like, read them. I'm not very good at, like, I always have to go back when I read anyways, but um, and...
There was a way to mute it, too, or we could have turned it down. I'm sorry. I didn't notice it was causing a problem for you. I have heard the song so many times that I have tuned it out.
... The bios were helpful to make decisions, like that, and yeah.
\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage\section*{Subject 5}
\begin{lstlisting}
What is your favorite subject when you're doing schoolwork
Maybe math.
Why's that
Just because it's fun to solve problems, Because I'm a problem solver, and because I like to know why it works, not just how it works.
What is your favorite app?
I don't have one because I don't really use iPhones or anything like that
What about laptop or desktop computers, do you do any work on those?
Yes. Probably Windows, PC.
What's your favorite kind of thing to do on Windows--what kind of programs do you run on it?
I don't know... Age of Empires is a game that is  a CD, stick it in the computer, but most of that I use for like schoolwork and stuff
You do some school work on the computer?
Yeah
Do you ever think about the people who make those programs
Sometimes
What do you think they look like?
I don't think about what they look like, I just think about how hard it would have been, and how long it would have taken, and how many people it would have taken.
How many people do you think it takes?
ha, a lot, over a long period of time
Well, what makes you think that---what makes you think it would be very hard?
Well, at least for Age of Empires, because it is, there is a bunch of like a whole lot of editing and like the, you know what the game Age of Empires is?
Yes
Well, just cause it's like, there's a lot of different things, and you have to make all the commands do the things, and stuff.
Do you have any experience with programming or making your own programs---coding?
Yeah, somewhat.
What kind of stuff have you done?
Well, I've done the Google's Code.org, and I've done some of GameSalad, some stuff on GameSalad Creator.
Great. My son uses one called GameMaker which is a nice program too
Is it free?
"Yeah, there's a free one, and uh we're going to start using another one soon called Construct 2 which a student had recommended to me, so I'm going to check it out.
So, when you think about these people who make these apps, whether they're making things to help people do schoolwork, or... instead of 'apps' let me just say 'programs', people are making Age of Empires or people are making programs you use to help you do your schoolwork, what do you think they studied in school?"
pffffooo. Lots of stuff. Animation, first off for a lot of them, and programming, and stuff. Like, and they would math and stuff.
OK, anything else?
uh, well, all the basics, well everybody does, for the most part.
Well the beauty of being homeschooled is that you get to define what the basics are, so what do you think the basics are?
That's true.
That's why we homeschool too---we can define the basics for ourselves.
English, uh English, Math, Science, uh... well, we say Bible too, and then ... I feel like i'm missing one. I forget what it is.
OK. Want to try the game out?
[explain think aloud, and starting the game]

Do I click to...?
mm hmm

[end of intro]

I have to make the.. do stuff?
mm hmm
... so, what do I do?
You can start by clicking down here, on the alerts button

[explain how to change tasks and clicking faces to learn about workers]
[he goes through and reads about each worker]

"[has expanded bottom worker, so the main interaction area is not visible]
So then, I don't exactly understand what I'm supposed to do"
If you click on Melissa again, the other screen will come up, and she [Frieda] will tell you
OK

Do you know what a press release is?
mmmm no
[explains it]

[After sending one worker to deal with a different task, probably security conference]
Can you tell me why you switched them both to maintenance just now?
Ah, because the one is gone, so [inaudible]
OK

"[Looking at daughter advice screen]
Is it just one of them?"
You can only choose one, right. Can you tell me about how you're making your decision?
Um, because I think it would either be one of these two [CS and Graphic Design], because this [CS] would be more of programming and how to work the, and how to work the computers, and this [graphic design] would be more like the designy parts of it, so I think it could be either of these. Ah... let's just say... [clicks Computer Science]

"[He is looking over the event where 'report to police' is an option]
Can you tell me about the decision you're trying to make?"
Um, no, I don't really know. Um... don't really know, it's either one of these two [ignore/report], I think, but I don't know. ... Hmmm... I don't really know, so I think I need to say report to the police. 

So, how do I make it go down?
The chart?
The, yeah
The chart actually is showing your, if you click on status you can take a look at it while the game's paused, this is showing how many users you have, so you actually want that to go up
OHH!
You want users up and you want exploits to be low.
I see. I see. I was, I thought that this [progress toward goal] was the one you had to keep below 15%.
Ah, no, the estimated exposure, if you click on status here [he does], it's the estimated exposure you want less than 15%. This one [progress toward goal] you want to go up.
The.... exposure... I see, OK, OK. I'm like, [adopts panicked voice] "Oh oh how do I make that go down?! Cause I just lost!" OK.

[talks to himself, inaudibly. he does this occasionally, often when reading on-screen text]

"[Facing the password event]
[laughs] Encrypt it [laughs] That's not one of the options. [laughs] Would this [train] be training to encrypt it, basically?"
Well, that's an interesting question. Encrypting is something you do on the server-side, to protect your data, but it's not something that guy... guy in advertising, something that they can do directly.
Right.
So, yeah, so those are the two choices that they give you.

Can I look them up and then get back to this?
What's that?
Can I look at them and then get back to this?
Yes, yes.
OK

What's PPH, or , PHP? [Vani's interest]
PHP is a programming language for making Web sites.
OK.

"[ Looking at end game screen ]
Are exploits and features good or bad, what are these?"
Features are good and produce users, but the exploits cost you users.
Mm kay.

[game ends]

When you played the game, did anything surprise you?
Well, it first, uh, where it's uh of the thing it says you just got attacked, whatever, and then, after that it wasn't really surprising, it was just like, OK, I got it, whatever
So you're saying---I want to make sure I understand---the first time you were attacked by hackers, you were surprised, and then after that you kind of expected them to attack some more.
Yeah, I tried to get ready for it, ... and then, uh, it's I actually kind of liked it, I liked the way you have to try and run your company, I just kind of like that type of thing. I don't know about other kids, but [trails off]
Sure. Anything else surprise you in the game?
... I don't think so
Can you tell me about what kinds of decisions you had to make while you played?
Whether or not to have somebody work on, like, whether or not to make things to create, uh, send people to, uh, to get trained so that they're more effective, then whether or not to have some try to find the hackers, and whether or not to, uh, whether I thought I could handle it by myself or talk to the police or whatever
Do you remember when you were prompted, you had the option to send someone to a security conference, you sent Nancy. Do you remember why you sent Nancy?
Because she was the one that was, I don't remember what it was, because of when I was reading about the people
In their descriptions?
In their descriptions. 
Sure. So do you think that you could get a job making apps?
Yes.
Why do you say that?
Um, well, if I'm, ... you mean me personally?
Yeah
Um, maybe, yes probably because I like to, uh, I can, ah, work on like programming stuff [inaudible] programming.
How does someone get a job making apps? How do you imagine they end up having that job?
ummm, through an interview [chuckle]
What do you think leads to the interview---trace backwards from there
Well, somebody would hear about you, and uh, you probably need to get a degree, or be an entrepreneur and start your own app-making business
Mmhmm, "entrepreneur" is a big word for a twelve year old---that's a good word.
Antidisestablishmentarianism.
[both laugh] That's a good word too! Do you know anybody that's started their own business?
Well, me, my brother---well, me and then my older brother, the one who's not here, uh, [inaudible] friends, yeah.
And you started your own business
Yeah, it's, we, uh, got a little machine that takes pictures of old slides so that I can, people will send in a box or whatever of slides and I'll take pictures of them and convert them--or I'll take pictures of them and convert them to digital, and I'll give them a CD with them on it for 25 cents a slide
Great, that's cool
Do you have any questions for me or any questions about things that you saw?
Mmm not really, um, the one thing is, just at the very, at first, if I were playing the game, if I didn't have anybody here, at first, I wouldn't know what to do, because I saw the thing flashing, but I didn't know you were supposed to click on it.
Sure. There's some places where it's a little rough around the edges, it's not quite ready for public release, and that's one of the reasons we're bringing people to play it early.

\begin{lstlisting}
What's your favorite subject in school
I'd say lunch but that probably doesn't count
I'll take lunch!
Sure.
Or you can list more than one, it doesn't have to be a single one.
I don't, I'm not a big fan of school
That's allright
I mean, I know I have to do it, but it's not very fun
Sure
What's your favorite app?
Favorite app...
or favorite computer program generally.
Uh... I don't know, I like Minecraft. It's fun.
What do you like about Minecraft.
I don't know, it's just fun, I'm creative so I like building stuff. So... I don't know.
So, if you think about a program like Minecraft---started by one guy, you probably know, and then now it's being worked on by a very large team of people
right
have you ever imagined those people that do that work, the people that work on minecraft?
Mm, well not necessarily Minecraft specifically, but I've thought about that kind of thing
What do you think they look like, the people that work on that?
I don't know. Probably, I don't know. Probably most of them are not American, probably a lot of them are from Japan, it's a Japanese company, isn't it? And then, I don't know. Probably just mostly that, just a bunch of geeky guys that sit at their computers and program Minecraft all day.
OK, and do you think they went to college and what do you think they studied?
It probably depends on what ones, and they probably studied, like, animation or, I don't know, something like that
And so these same people that you're imagining, what do you think their favorite school subjects would have been?
Probably art or math.
OK.

[introduce the game]

[finish intro]

[ explain task changing, tap on faces to learn more about them ]

[ mumbles to himself while making some choices, but nothing clear ]

Can you tell me about how you're making this decision?
I don't really know, I'll just kind of guess, I could report it to the police, or I could task someone to try to figure it out. I'll probably just task somebody to figure it out for now because, I don't really feel like getting mixed up with the police, so I'll task [someone] to do it.

OK, so I should not actually have had him do it.
Why do you say that?
Because he got a degree in electrical engineering and he got a degree in computer science, so... [trails off] [tries changing the task]
Yeah, once he's on a special task he cannot be taken off of it.
I can't... OK

OK, tell Jerry to do it.

Hm, interesting

OK, so I have to figure out... how to fix the problem. Somehow.

Interesting, it's raising faster.

Oops, I should have sent...
What were you going to say?
I should have sent this guy.

Ok, so, that's the end?
That's the end
OK, cool.

Did anything in the game surprise you?
uh, yeah, a little bit. It kind of surprised me the random losing the customers because of the stuff popping up. So, then, I was kind of, like I didn't really know what I was doing, so I was trying to figure it out, and ... so then, it was like, I hadn't researched, I hadn't looked up who, I hadn't learned anything about my employees at the beginning, so I accidentally told the wrong guy to do something, uh
And that was, you said before, you thought it was the wrong guy because he had the electrical engineering degree instead of computer science?
I mean, he still got it done, but yeah, and then, yeah, I guess. So that was pretty much it.
When you had options to send people to the security conference, you sent Jerry, the guy at the bottom. Do you remember why you sent Jerry?
Yeah, I sent him just because he was uh he was one of the uh um computer science people. I figured he might be more helpful to, uh, computer science guys at a security conference.
Sure. And I noticed too when James from accounting brought his daughter to work, you looked over the options and you chose Computer Science there too. Do you remember why you chose that?
Uh, just because it seems like that's what, it seems like making an app would be more computers and that stuff than anything else.
OK, Tell me about where apps come from.
Anybody that makes them.
Can you say a little bit more?
So if somebody decides they want to make an app and they know, they sit down and do it. If they don't know how, and they still want to do it, then depending on how complex the app is they either go to try to figure it out at some random source, or if it's a bigger, more complex project, they go take classes for it... and then they make the app.
Do you think that you could get a job making apps?
Probably, if I wanted to.
Why do you say that?
cause if I learned how to do stuff and then, I don't know, applied for jobs, especially if I got a degree, because people would be more likely to want someone with a degree in app development, or something along those lines
Do you have any questions about anything that you saw or any questions for me about the study.
[negative]

\begin{lstlisting}
What's your favorite subject in school?
I like English and science
What do you like about those?
You get to be more creative than in other classes
What's your favorite app?
[perplexed]
Do you have a favorite app? Do you use any computer programs that you like?
Mmm, not really, I'm ... I've been trying to learn how to like develop games, but [trails off]
What kind of work have you done along those lines? Or what have you been reading?
I've been, I've read homestuck, and I've been inspired to make a webcomic that I don't have a name for yet, but I'm writing the script for it.
[offtopic homestuck]
Can you try to imagine the people who write computer software, who write apps.  Can you imagine what they might look like?
[perplexed]
Or could you describe how you imagine they would look?
I imagine them to be like 17 to sort of early 20s in age, but appearancewise, I can't really [trails off]
Can you imagine what subjects they would like in school?
Probably English and Computers
Why do you say those?
Because in English, you get to learn how to develop characters and plot and stuff, and Computers, obviously, you learn who to deal with computers.

[introduce game]
[slide two, chuckles at the protect from hackers]
"You have three employees"--that's not a lot! [chuckle]

[ explain task change and tap to learn about employees ]

"[DDOS event]
Angry customer?!"

Can you tell me why you chose Jerry?
He seemed like with all, well, hold on, [opens his profile] "He worked for a local company in high school and has worked as a software developer ever since" so it seems like he would have the most experience and .. most, like .. willingness I guess.

"[looking at exploits screen]
[hushed shout]Fix it!"

"[Script kiddie event]
Just a script kiddie, so [trails off]"

[Spends some time looking at exploits list]

[angrily, hushed] Gosh, so many alerts.

[end] Yay!

Did anything surprise you while playing the game?
I think maybe the amount of exploits and all the choices, sort of, that you had to make.
And can you tell me why that was surprising to you?
That was, I mean, I know that starting up anything there's going to be some problems, but I didn't expect that many that quickly.
When you had the choice to have one of your employees investigate the injection attack--it was kind of toward the end of the game--you chose Jerry pretty quickly. Do you remember why you chose Jerry?
Yeah, well he seemed the most well-trained out of all of them, and the girl--I forget her name--she seemed more like someone who should be with, like, social, and not developer, but Jerry seemed like the better person for the job of that kind of thing.
How would you describe the decisions that you had to make in the game?
You really had to think of what sort of impact it would have later in the game when you would choose them, but you also had to make them kind of quickly, so... [trails off]
So how did you make those decisions? You mentioned thinking about future impact.
Thinking about how many people you could have lost, or how many people you can gain, from certain choices you take, so [trails off]
Do you think that you could get a job making apps, like at this company?
Yes.
Why do you say that?
... Like, it feels like, uh ... the way the company was going it was going on like strong and reliable and being able to tell users what's going on,  so... [trails off]
I don't disagree that you could work there, I just wondered what you thought about it. So, how does somebody get a job making apps?
They would have to learn how to code and script and stuff, and be able to like produce a game that people would play with it, and be able to develop a plot and a story, or whatever you needed for that game.... while still being semi-entertaining. 
Do you have any questions about anything that you saw, or any questions about the study that we're doing?
[negative]

\begin{lstlisting}
What is your favorite subject in school?
Math.
And what is your favorite app?
Tererria.
Oh thats cool! Great game. So who are the people who made Tererria?
Like...they have huge computers. Spend a lot of time working. Oh, and there have to be some super talented artists. The people probably went to college for like engineering.
You said engineering. What do you think their favorite subjects were when they were in school?
Uh...Probably science or math. Mainly that.
[introduce game]
[game play notes] He actually read all of the text. There were a lot of events from the get go so time took a long time to actually move (4 events in day 1).
[He took time to decide whether to do nothing or report to the police.]

How was it?
It was fun and different.
Was there anything that surprised you?
Yeah when the guy asked...I mean the guy's daughter asked about what she should study, I was surprised there wasn't the option to choose more than one thing.
Oh and what all would you have chosen?
Computer Science like I did. And engineering and math.
Ok that interesting. What kinds of decisions did you have to make?
Uhm...
Rather what were the choice you made and how did you make them?
I had to choose, like, the skill to have people on, and I used their degree. What they were best at. The other things I thought about what was good or what would get the most...points...Users. Yeah users.
So again, where do app come from?
Code and computer programs. And I guess the people who write the codes. Computer scienctists and engineers.
Do you think you could get a job making apps?
Yeah I do.
Why?
Well I've coded at my school at the beginning of the year and I was pretty good at it.
Oh so you've coded?
Well not really coded. It was like where we had to put things together...
So block coding?
Yeah, that!
What grade are you in?
Sixth.
Thats very cool. So how does someone get a job making software?
Probably get a degree. Spend four years in college. And arists...would have to practice a lot. Spend time getting better. And become tech savvy.
Ok. So lastly, do you have any questions for me?
No.
All right, thank you so much!
\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage\section*{Subject 9}
\begin{lstlisting}
Ok so thats recording. So I'm just going to ask you a few questions to start out with. Whats your favorite subject in school?
Uh...academic?
Yes.
I'd say english.
Ok and then just broad favorite subject in general?
Art. Or band. Either one.
Ok and thats visual art? So like drawing and painting.
Yes.
Whats your favorite type of app?
Drawing.
So like you have...?
I like sketchbook pro. Its my favorite.
And then who are the type of people who make sketchbook pro?
Adobe I think.
And if you think about the actual people who made that?
The people? *pause* I don't know...
Ok yeah, thats a valid answer.
Yeah I've got no idea on that one.
So no idea like maybe what they would look like or what they studied in college if they went to college?
They probably went to college if they are making such a large app. And working for adobe. They probably al crazy mad scientist. Like...Muahaha. We are gonna make this crazy app so people can draw.
Ok and then what...when those people were in school, what do you think their favorite subjects were?
Probably math and computer sciences...maybe art. Yeah.
Ok.
[Introduces Game]
[First Play Through]
The music is groovy.
Do you have what it takes? Yessss
Idk, I really like nancy. Soo I think I'm going to go with...oh Oh, what do? Oh, ok.
So she has a bachelors of english...oh my mom when to Georgetown! Nancy has a popular podcast about being a woman in technology. Oh thats cool!
Bruce has a... [reads text]
Ok lets see what Janine has for us. [Reads Text] Ok! I think I'm gonna go with Janine, because she sounds really cool.
So all three of them are your employees.
Yeeeahh I like them. They're cool.
Ok so status...features...oh selfie of the week!
[reads instructions]
[does not reassign anyone]
Ok. So. So we still don't have a selfie of the week!
Oh no, 55 users left....no! [notify users option response]
Oh. Oh no. You were attacked... [reads text] Oh *frantic* I'm going with! Ok. ok *frantic* uhm....especially talented at meting with customers...has a popular podcasts... and he...ok. I think I'm gonna go with Janine, because she is my favorite. So...or. Or report to the police. Because thats probably something I should do. 
The police found the hackers! Free publicity! Wow thanks hacker guy.
Our users are really going up. This is going great.
Oh oh! I'm really liking this. I have a lot of users now. They're really liking my game. You don't even know how happy this is making me. 
Oh! Oh no. An angry customer... [text] Just gonna wait this out. NO? After two hours...no! So many users, 437 have left because...jeez. sorry. 
I would say computer science. 
Oh one of your workers can go [text]. Ok I'm gonna send bruce because he sounds like he spends too much time watching history documentaries.
James from accounting called [text] Oh wow. That makes me feel so good about myself!
OK I'm gonna send Nancy because Janine is my fav and we uh need her handy.
Oh Bruce came back! With greatly increased maintance skill. Oh wow that is greatly increased.
Uhm...lets train the staff because why not.
Because you could fit..uh...what...no....ok. Its ok, at least we fixed it.
Two hundred...left..no stop leaving me! Thankfully we took time train our staff. Good! Good it wont happen again. I need my users.
Oh mannnn oh I really didn't get enough users.
Ok one second. *aside* So I don't need to clear the logs? Just restart, correct?
Yes, we will just append the logs.
Cool!
Ok so I'm gonna show you something at the beginning that will make the game easier for you.
Ok! I like Nancy, she is sassy. All of them are sassy.

[Start game 2]
Oh! New people. I like this guy. (Ivar)
Alright so if you go down here. And click this. Here Frieda says you can reassign any of the to development? So click here, yeah, and you can put them on development. So last time...
They were all on maintanance.
Correct, so you weren't actually making any new features.
Wooah this is crazy. I like Ivar, he looks kinda creepy and I love it. I like his creepy long hair with a bald head.
So you see how the features...yeah the progress is at 42%? Its going up because its actually being made.
Oh wow! Wow look at that...tumblr...wow.
One of your workers can go to a two day conference...no I'm not gonna send Ivar because I don't want him to creep out all the...I'm gonna send Vani.
[Feature Completed] Oh wow, so many people. They love my game! Or...whatever we are doing. I think its a game. Yeah its a game!
Oh report this to the police. The police will help.
Vani, yes, my fav! Great maintanance, wow. I'm changing you to development.
And I reached my goal!
Hackers stole some users data. Ohhh Ignore it! Phew avoided that. -- An independent securiy...wha---No! Maaaan.
Its ok. Its ok.
An angry customer....I'm just gonna wait this one out. Nooooo come back! Ok. Ok.
This is intense, honestly.
One of our engineers....ok. Estaban. I'm gonna have you doing that.
Ok, train this staff. And now everyone left because they're like, "Wow. They're dumb. Don't have good taste in game."
Aghh almost there. Just did a lot of bad exposure things
[end game]

Ok so I just have a couple more questions. Did anyting surprise?
The first time I didn't get the development thing. That really changed it.
Anything about the story or the characters?
I really liked it actually. Nothing that like surprised me that completely caught my attention. It all seemed pretty natural, nothing seemed out of place.
Thank you. What types of decisions did you have to make in this? And how did you, uhm, decide. How did you make those decisions?
Uhm when the hackers were on me, I had to decide what I'd let the public know, and what I didn't want to let the public know. 
Mmm hmm.
So I thought that was kinda cool. I really liked how I had to choose which one went and did the jobs.
So having gone through this a couple times, how did the decisions pan out from when you let the public know to when you didn't? Did one end up being better?
See, last time I was like "oh I'll let them know, and everyone got mad." So I thought I'd just keep it a secret. But then when I was exposed, everyone was like, "why didn't you tell use that." They all got really mad and left me, which I think is what made my exposure go up. But last the didn't like that. This time they don't like it more. 
Yeah. Ok I'm gonna stop this music from playing. So where do apps come from/
Uhm, computer developers and companies. A lot of them come from apple itself. Because, ya know, the apps that are already on then. Yeah, coding obviously. You can't really make a computer program witout coding.
Do you think you could get a job making an app?
I think I could, yeah! I seem to be pretty good at coding in the coding classes we have at school. We have on called B.I.T. I don't remember exactly what it stands for, but you do a lot of coding in that. 
Thats cool.
I think I totally could.
How does someone get a job making apps?
I assume that after they get a degree in computer science, or I'm sure there a school that specializes in like app creation. You could go to like adobe, like the ones that made the sketchbook app, uhm, if you're looking for more artistic or graphic designee stuff. Or you could go to apple. Game companies, develop applications there. 
Is there software that exists outside of game companies?
Yeah like...uhm...scheduling and planning. And like...thats the only one I can think of because I don't use them much. OH music! How could I forget that. There are a lot of music applications.
Ok so the last thing, do you have any questions for me?
No.
Cool. Well then--
Let me throw in a question from left field here. What is it that made you like Janine so much?
Uhm. She was idk. From her description she seemed really on it. She seemed really cool. I liked her a lot.
And at the very beginning, the first thing you said was that you liked, uhm--
Nancy?
Yes, Nancy. Was there a reason? That was before you had openend up and read about her.
She looked really sassy. And she looked like me before I went insane. Cuz I used to have long blond hair and that was normal. It was gross. But she was really sassy so I liked her. Sassy like not really sassy but like, cool. Like she looked hip with the kids.
Yeah! Ok, I think thats all we have. Thank you!
\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage\section*{Subject 10}
\begin{lstlisting}
Ok So your favorite subject is?
History.
Whats your favorite app?
Facebook.
Ok. Any others?
Mostly social media. Facebook, Instagram...I have this called wattpad I used all the time.
Where do the apps from?
From the app store. People make them and sell them on the app store.
What do you think those people are like?
Like they know how to program stuff. And...they know how to use the technology to build the apps to put them on the appstore for people to use.
If you had to describe the way that they look?
The way that they look? Uhm...smart? Or...I don't know. They look smart or techy I guess.
Do you think they went to college?
Most likely. Probably.
What do you think they studied?
Uhm, I'm not sure.
Thats ok! Valid answer. 
[Introduces game]
>>5:30<<
[end game]
So. What surprised you in that?
Well there was like, a lot of different...ok. It was different from any video game I've played. I had to think about what I was doing before I just clicked anything. I had to figure out what this button meant before I started just doing something. I had to kind of learn as I went.
What types of decisions did you have to make?
Well I had to decide whether I just reset the password or I would train everyone on how to decide on passwords so that they wouldn't get broken into again. And then I had to decide which person was going to do the maintanance part and which person did the development part. And that probably affected...something.
Yeah when you...did you see...you saw the features page and how the percentage was going up?
Yeah.
The people working on that were the feature people, and the people on maintance were on the exploits page, the things taking away users, the people on maintance were getting rid of those. So how did you make those decisions. 
Well I've always thought about not having weak passwords, so for the password one, I always try to make them as strong as possible so no could find them out. And for the other ones I just experimented for the first minute to figure out which was the better one.
Specifically about the one where it said someone had attacked your company and you had the option to retaliate, why did you decide to realiate?
I guess I'm an agressive person. I was kind of..
Was it good?
No, I probably shouldn't have. I probably should have let the police handle it instead of taking it into my hands.
Maybe. Good to know. Where do apps come from?
People like you who make them and develop them. Take a lot of time to make them.
What do those people look like?
Like you? Like normal people.
Just like me?
Like anybody!
What did you notice about the characters?
I noticed some of them had degrees from Ball State. And then they didn't look like smart people, they looked like normal people.
Do you think you could get a job making apps?
Possibly, if I thought about it and was patient with myself, then probably.
Why?
I can because I don't have to be super smart. you still have to have some knowledge about how to program and everything, but I think once I learned how to do that I would have a little bit more...uhm...chance of being more successful and making an app or a game.
So after having practiced?
Yeah!
Alright so last thing, any questions?
Nope! It was fun.
\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage\section*{Subject 11}
\begin{lstlisting}
All right, I'm just gonna start with a few questions. First off, what is your favorite subject in school?
Hmm...probably Gym. Does it have to be like an englihs or math?
No, thats good. But if you had to pick an academic one?
Probably science.
Alright, whats your favorite app? Which one do you use the most.
I don't actually have my own personal device like that, but we have a family one, so...
It could be, like, whats your favorite game? If you play video games?
When I do play, probably Clash of Clans.
Alright. Where do apps come from? Like apps or games.
The app store? Or do you mean before that?
Uhm. Yes, but, if you think of the people who made them.
Well I do read who made them, if its like catch app or someone like that.
If you think about the individual people who work on them, what would you say they look like?
Like, physical appearian--appea--
Mhhmm, appearance.
Uhm.
And so you know, I don't know is a valid answer throughout this whole process.
Yeah, I don't know.
Do you think they went to college?
I would assume so to learn how to make it. But I have some friends who can program stuff who haven't been to college, so.
If they did go to college, what do you think they majored in?
Probably some sort of technology...computer science maybe.
Alright, thats all I have beforehand.
[introduces game]
Whats a press release?
Its--like contacting a news station, or I guess today using social media. Saying what happened, letting the public know what is going on. 
Ah ok.
[end game]
Alright, do you want a second go on that? You figured out half way through that you can change people's task, but that really affects the game. 
Yeah, I'd like to give it a try.
Alright lets start you off. So I'm not sure what happened last time, but right here are the instructions, so you can read through those.
[Start Game]
[End game]
So did anything surprise you?
Well, a lot of the video games I play aren't very realistic. This one is pretty down to earth. In like the things that happen. And up to date.
So, what types of decisions did you have to make.
Well you had to work with your customers and learn how to make them happy while also...uhm...increase your benefit and keeping away people who wanted to steal that.
How did you make those decisions?
Well I knew some of them would hurt me no matter what I did so like the best possible answers. And some of them, I really didn't know what to do, so I just guessed.
Do you remember any in particular you just guessed about?
Uhm...The one, the first problem. Where you could tell the police about it or send someone after it.
The first time you played through you chose to have someone retaliate and the second time, you reported it to the police.
Yeah, neither of those worked, I probably should have just done nothing. --- I don't really remember what happened with the police, actually.
You celebrated because they found who it was and you got users because of the publicity.
Oh! I thought that was a different...ok nevermind! I thought it was a different one. Yeah that one worked, so I went with that.
Same question from before, where do programs and apps come from?
Uhm, yeah people, groups of, like, you buy them from the app store, but people will make them on their own. Or different organisations. 
Do you think you could get a job making apps?
I could but thats...thats not really...I don't know a whole lot about it. I could if I took that career path.
What is that career path? How do you get to that?
There was computer science on there and that worked both times I tried that, so probably something like that. Thers probably a lot of mathematics and, you know, how you have to know how games work or what other people did to make the games.
Yeah so how do people in general gets jobs in making software? Like do you think they went to college and studied and?
My uncle has a job in computer software but he didn't graduate from college. So I don't think you have to.
So there are multiple ways?
Yes. 
Alright I think thats all...one more. What did you think about the characters? You read their bios several times. 
I thought that was probably a pretty balanced team, because you had someone who, like, majored in three of the important categories, such as computer engineering. I can't remember what the one in the middle was, and then there was another one who was good at working with people and finding out what they want. Thats why I chose her to do the--oh no, I chose the engineering one to teach people how to do the password thing because he knew how to make a safe password. And then I would have chosen her to find out what people liked or stuff like that.
Alright thats all I have. Do you have any questions for me?
Not really.

I'm going to start off by just asking you a few questions. Whats your favorite subject?
Writing.
Alright. What is your favorite app or game? On technology.
I don't know.
Where do apps and games come from?
A creator.
So a person makes it. What...what do you think that person looks like? If you had to imagine the person who makes these things, what would you say they look like?
I don't know, I've nevers seen them.
Ok. Do you think that they went to college?
Probably.
If they did, what do you think they studied?
Computer technology.
[introduces game]
Is it just gonna move on, or?
Just click on the screen.
*time passes*
So every time this flashes, time stops and it has someting for you.
*time passes*
What is...?
Ok, if you click here, you'll see...right there, 28% on development? If you put someone's task to that, they work on completing it. That percentage will go up. Once you take care of this event, that'll start goin up again.
*time passes*
What do these do?
Uhm...so now time has stopped since there is something here. Click on this one. These are are things that take users, but since you have him on maintance, this one is already fixed. Now click here. These are things you are making. She is working on those and once you have that you'll start making more users.
[end game]
Did anything surprise you?
Not really.
Ok. What types of choices did you have to make?
Uhm. Like whether or not to train staff and have them not working for a time.
Mmhmm. And how did you make that decision? How did you choose whether or not to do that and who to send?
I don't know...
Ok! Thats fair. After having played, same question, where do apps come from?
The creator.
Do you think you could...when you're grown up, do you think you could get a job making software--making apps?
No.
Why not?
Because its something that interests me so its not something I could work very hard at.
Ok. What do you find interesting?
*confused silence*
Another way--what do you want to be when you grow up?
Really, only God knows what I'll be and I, I don't know.
Ok! Fair. In general, how do you think someone gets a job making apps?
You would go to college and study and...get hired or start a business.
Mmhmm. Study what?
Computer science.
Alright. Those are all the questions I have for you. Do you have any for me?

You mean like a game or anything online?
It can be anything really. If your favorite happens to be the dictionary app, thats alright too!
I don't really have one.
Ok. Thats fair. Where do apps come from? 
Well, people have to make em.
Mmhmm. Describe those people.
